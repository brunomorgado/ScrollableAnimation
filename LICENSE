ScrollableAnimation [![](http://img.shields.io/badge/iOS-8.0%2B-lightgrey.svg)]()
=====

ScrollableAnimation was built to mimic the normal way of animating layers with property based CAAnimation defined by a keyPath with the main difference being that the X axis of the animation timeline is an 'offset' instead of 'time'.

### Setup

Just copy ScrollableAnimation folder to your iOS 8 project;

### Usage

Create an animation controller for a particular context.

`
let animationController = ScrollableAnimationController()
`

Create an animation and add it to the layer you want to animate. Pass along the animation controller.

```swift
let animatableView = UIView(frame: CGRectMake(0, 0, 100, 100))
self.superView.addSubview(animatableView)
```

```swift
let rotation = ScrollableKeyframeAnimation(keyPath: "transform.rotation.z")
        rotation.beginOffset = 0
        rotation.distance = 600
rotation.keyOffsets = [0.0, 0.5, 1.0]
        rotation.values = [0.0, Float(M_PI), 0.0]
        rotation.functions = [TweenBlockEaseInQuad, TweenBlockEaseInQuad]
        animatableView.layer.addScrollableAnimation(rotation, forKey: "rotationAnimation", withController: animationController)
```

### Improvements

- Implement 'additive' functionality for ScrollableAnimation.

- Implement ScrollableAnimationDelegate.

- Optimize contents-based animations with texture atlases.
